# What gets pushed into QStash (readings + sessions)

> **Status:** current — last verified 2026-06-10.

How a poll's data reaches the QStash `observations` queue, and the exact JSON shapes.
Source of truth: `lib/observations/types.ts`, `lib/observations/publisher.ts`,
`lib/observations/session-publisher.ts`, `lib/qstash.ts`.

## TL;DR

A single poll produces **two or more independent QStash messages**, not one combined message:

1. **One readings message** (sometimes more) — published **mid-poll** by
   `publishObservationBatch()` (`lib/point/point-manager.ts:637`). It carries an
   `observations[]` array and **no** `session`.
2. **One session message** — published at **poll completion** by `publishSession()` (from
   `session-manager.updateSessionResult()`), _after_ the readings. It carries a `session` object
   and **no** `observations`.

They are separate messages with **no delivery-ordering guarantee** — the consumer can receive the
session before or after the readings that reference it. (This is why `point_readings.session_id`
has no enforced FK today; see the migration plan for the planned co-enqueue change.)

## The envelope — `QueueMessage`

Every message has the same envelope; `observations` and `session` are both optional, so a message
carries one or the other:

```jsonc
{
  "env": "prod", // "prod" | "dev"
  "systemId": 1,
  "systemName": "Home",
  "batchTime": "2026-06-05T14:32:10+10:00", // ISO8601 + system tz offset
  "observations": [
    /* ... */
  ], // present on readings messages
  "session": {
    /* ... */
  }, // present on session messages
}
```

## Readings message (`observations[]`)

A "slew of readings" from one poll is **batched into a single message's `observations` array** —
one element per point read, not one message per reading. Each `Observation`:

```jsonc
{
  "sessionId": "0190f3c2-...", // UUIDv7 string (historical ids are stringified ints)
  "topic": "liveone/select.live/abc123/battery_soc", // liveone/{vendorType}/{vendorSiteId}/{physicalPathTail}
  "measurementTime": "2026-06-05T14:32:00+10:00",
  "receivedTime": "2026-06-05T14:32:09+10:00",
  "value": 87.4, // number | string (text metrics) | null (errors)
  "interval": "raw", // "raw" -> point_readings | "5m" -> agg_5m | "1d" -> agg_1d
  "debug": {
    // optional, for inspection
    "type": "soc", // metricType
    "unit": "%", // metricUnit
    "pointName": "Battery SoC",
    "reference": "1.7", // {systemId}.{pointIndex}
  },
}
```

Three flavours of readings message, by `interval`:

- **`raw`** — the common case. Selectronic/Fusher polls publish their raw point readings here (via
  `insertPointReadingsRaw`). `value` only; no `agg`. **Always published** (this is the dual-write
  Postgres needs to self-compute its own aggregates).
- **`5m`** — 5-minute aggregates. Carries the full `agg` tuple:

  ```jsonc
  "agg": {
    "avg": 1850, "min": 1700, "max": 2010, "last": 1980, "delta": null,
    "valueStr": null, "sampleCount": 5, "errorCount": 0, "dataQuality": "good"
  }
  ```

  - **5m-native vendors** (Enphase, Amber) produce NO raw readings, so their 5m is the only
    copy — it is **always published** and the receiver **upserts** it (late `updateUsage`
    refinements must overwrite).
  - **Raw vendors** (Selectronic/Fusher/…): their 5m is **no longer published when
    `AGG_COMPUTE_IN_PG` is on** (PR-13) — Postgres recomputes it from PG's own raw, so the
    queue copy would be a redundant double-write. With `AGG_COMPUTE_IN_PG` off it is published
    as before (and the receiver inserts it first-write-wins).

- **`1d`** — daily aggregates from the nightly cron. Same `agg` tuple, but `valueStr`/`dataQuality`
  are unused (the daily table has no such columns). **No longer published when `AGG_COMPUTE_IN_PG`
  is on** (PR-13) — Postgres recomputes 1d from its own 5m; published as before when the flag is off.

In short, on the queue today (`AGG_COMPUTE_IN_PG` on): **`raw` + sessions + 5m-native `5m`** always
flow; **raw-vendor `5m`** and **`1d`** no longer do. A straggler of either still reaches the
receiver harmlessly as a logged no-op.

For aggregated observations the full `agg` tuple is sent so the Postgres mirror is full-fidelity
rather than collapsing everything into the single `value` field. Raw observations omit `agg`.

## Session message (`session`)

Published once, at poll completion, after `updateSessionResult` fills in the outcome:

```jsonc
{
  "sessionId": 12345,
  "sessionLabel": "a1b2", // nullable; e.g. deployment-id suffix
  "cause": "CRON", // CRON | ADMIN | USER | PUSH | ...
  "started": "2026-06-05T14:32:00+10:00",
  "durationMs": 9300,
  "successful": true, // true | false | null (pending)
  "errorCode": null,
  "error": null,
  "response": {
    /* full vendor response, JSON */
  },
  "numRows": 42,
  "startTime": "2026-06-05T14:32:00+10:00", // when the session row was created
}
```

Note the session is created (pending, `successful: null`) at poll **start** and only **published**
after it completes — so its message necessarily trails the readings messages it owns.

## Worked example — one poll, a slew of readings + a session

For a poll of system 1 that reads 42 points and succeeds, QStash receives, in order of publish
(not guaranteed order of delivery):

1. **Readings message** — one envelope whose `observations` array holds 42 `raw` entries, all
   stamped with the same `sessionId`. (Published mid-poll.)
2. **Session message** — one envelope with the `session` object (`numRows: 42`, `successful: true`).

If the poll reads enough points to exceed a batch, `insertPointReadingsRaw` may be called more than
once, producing more than one readings message — each a self-contained envelope.

## Transport mechanics

- **Queue:** `observations` (production) / `observations-dev` (development) — `lib/qstash.ts:15`.
- **Publish:** `qstash.queue({ queueName }).enqueueJSON({ url, body })` where `body` is the
  `QueueMessage`. No-ops silently if `OBSERVATIONS_QSTASH_TOKEN` is unset.
- **Receiver URL:** the stable public domain `https://www.liveone.energy/api/observations/receive`
  (prod) or `…/receive-dev` (dev). Must be a public custom domain — a `*.vercel.app` per-deployment
  URL is gated by Deployment Protection (401) and QStash can't pass it.
- **Delivery:** QStash POSTs each message to the receiver and signs it; the receiver verifies the
  signature, writes to Postgres, and **returns 500 on any failure so QStash retries** (at-least-once
  delivery — handlers must be idempotent).

## Planned change (migration context)

Under the Postgres-primary migration this becomes **one combined message per poll, emitted at
session close**: the completed `session` plus all its `observations` in a single envelope. The
gap between the last reading and session close is milliseconds, so buffering to close costs
negligible latency, and the receiver can insert the session then its readings in one transaction
— making the message self-contained and enabling a real `point_readings.session_id → sessions.id`
foreign key. (Session ids are already app-generated **UUIDv7** strings, stored as `text`.) A poll
that would exceed QStash's 1 MB message limit (10 MB on the Fixed-1M plan) chunks its readings
across messages that share the session id. Until that ships, the two-independent-messages
behaviour above (readings mid-poll, session at completion) is current.
