# Production Migration Retrospective
## Date: 2025-01-30

### Timeline of Issues

1. **11:45** - Code deployed successfully to Vercel
2. **11:46** - Database migration executed (vendor_type/vendor_site_id)
3. **11:47** - Site returns 404 errors
4. **11:48** - Discovered missing `user_systems` table in production
5. **11:49** - Created and ran emergency migration for `user_systems` table
6. **11:50** - Fixed incorrect Clerk user IDs
7. **11:51** - Manually added Craig's system and permissions
8. **11:52** - Site still showing 404 (unresolved)

### Root Causes

1. **Incomplete Schema Tracking**
   - The `user_systems` table was added to dev but never migrated to production
   - No process to track schema divergence between environments

2. **Insufficient Migration Testing**
   - Only tested the primary migration (vendor_type changes)
   - Didn't verify ALL tables needed by the new code

3. **Hardcoded Values in Migration**
   - Used placeholder Clerk ID instead of actual production value
   - No configuration management for user-specific data

4. **Missing Deployment Verification**
   - No automated health checks post-deployment
   - No staging environment to catch issues

### Impact
- ~7 minutes of partial outage
- Manual intervention required
- Potential data inconsistency during migration

### Action Items

#### Immediate
- [x] Add `user_systems` table to production
- [x] Fix user IDs in production
- [x] Add Craig's system and permissions
- [ ] Investigate remaining 404 issue

#### Short-term
- [ ] Create schema comparison script
- [ ] Add pre-deployment checklist to CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Create staging environment
- [ ] Add health check endpoints

#### Long-term
- [ ] Implement automated schema migrations (Drizzle Kit)
- [ ] Add integration tests for all API endpoints
- [ ] Create deployment pipeline with automatic rollback
- [ ] Implement feature flags for gradual rollout

### What Went Well
- Quick identification of issues
- Rollback script was prepared (though not needed)
- Database backup was created before migration
- Migration was atomic (all-or-nothing)

### Recommendations

1. **Schema Management**
   ```bash
   # Add to deployment process
   npm run db:push  # Push schema changes
   npm run db:migrate  # Run migrations
   ```

2. **Testing Protocol**
   - Always test on exact copy of production data
   - Verify all tables, not just changed ones
   - Test authentication flows specifically

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Never hardcode IDs in migrations
   - Use environment variables or config files
   - Maintain a production constants file

4. **Monitoring**
   - Add health check endpoint that verifies:
     - Database connectivity
     - All required tables exist
     - Authentication is working
   - Set up alerts for deployment failures

### Summary
The migration exposed gaps in our deployment process, particularly around schema management and testing. While we recovered quickly, implementing the above recommendations will prevent similar issues in future deployments.
